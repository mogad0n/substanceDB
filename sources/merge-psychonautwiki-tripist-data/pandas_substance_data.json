is a clear liquid with intoxicating effects. It is a pro-drug for GHB, and has similar though reportedly inferior effects. It also carries the potential for more health risks than GHB, such as liver toxicity.","1":"1B-LSD (1-butanoyl-lysergic acid diethylamide) is an LSD analogue which appears to be about as potent as 1P-LSD (slightly more potent than LSD) and has a slightly shorter duration than that of LSD, again thought to be about the same as 1P-LSD. Released in late 2018, and marketed agressively as a replacement for 1P-LSD. 1B-LSD does not yet have a clearly established safety profile,","2":"1cP-LSD (1-cyclopropionyl-lysergic acid diethylamide) is a novel lysergamide with little to no history of use. It is said to be a less pushy and shorter lasting version of LSD. Described as having a more gradual onset than 1P-LSD, with a less visual more meditative headspace when compared with LSD.*NOTE: This is a very new research chemical - take all info with a grain of salt.*","3":"A new psychedelic lysergamide which is suspected to be a prodrug of ETH-LAD, which could explain why the doses are very similar. Or it could be active on its own. Scientific studies would need to be written to understand, yet there are none.","4":"An LSD analogue which appears to be slightly more potent with a shorter duration. Its effects are reported to be extremely similar to LSD, and thus far seems to be similarly safe. Released in late 2014, It has quickly become a highly popular research chemical due to its implicit legality, similarity to LSD and wide availability on the Internet.","5":"Short acting stimulant that is sometimes compared to the likes of Methamphetamine. It is a rigid analogue of Amphetamine, and also partially substitutes for the prior in rat discrimination studies.","6":"Analogue of Ephenidine. Very little is known about this quite obscure compound. Very likely to exhibit dissociative effects, and is slightly less potent than the parent drug Ephenidine.","7":"A very potent stimulant that is a NDRI. Developed by Novartis in the 1950s, to treat narcolepsy and ADHD, however dropped when Methylphenidate was produced a few years later, which was seen as superior due to its shorter T½. 2-DPMP Half life 16-20 hours. Warning: subjective reports suggest this drug is caustic to the nasal mucosa and may cause damage to the nasal cavity.","8":"Stimulant drug of the amphetamine family. Reported as having effects similar to those of Dextroamphetamine, but with a milder euphoria and a comparatively smoother comedown. Has a shorter duration and less empathogenic effect-profile as compared with 4-FA. Thought to produce less neurotoxic metabolites compared to amphetamine.","9":"Dissociative anesthetic of the arylcyclohexylamine class. Seemingly on par with ketamine in dosage. Longer onset than the prior.","10":"Stimulant closely related to 2-FMA. Presumably slightly less potent than the prior. Toxicology and the likes are pretty much completely unknown. Tread with caution.","11":"A long-acting stimulant often compared to lisdexamphetamine. Thought to lack some of amphetamine's neurotoxic metabolites. Very functional, and for this reason it is commonly used for studying.","12":"Also known as 2,N,N-TMT, this drug was first synthesised by Alexander Shulgin. Described as a very mild psychedelic of similar subjective effects to other tryptamines. Reported as having an unusual and unpredictable dose curve, it is recommended to start low with this drug.","13":"Cathinone which some users report to feel like a weaker MDMA with a shorter onset.","14":"A tertiary alcohol that has sedative, hypnotic, and anxiolytic effects. It is also roughly 20x more potent than Ethanol by weight.","15":"Also known as Ortetamine, this rarely seen amphetamine is approximately 1\/10th as potent as dextroamphetamine.
